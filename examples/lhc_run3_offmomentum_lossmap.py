# In this example, the IR3 region gets populated very fast. When this is not the case, e.g. for injection,
# one should keep only the last part of the sweep (as this is what happens in reality), as follows:


# In reality the loss map only shows the last second (1.3s BLM integration time)
# A typical RF sweep in reality shifts around 25Hz per second, i.e. around 2.2mHz/turn.
# We sweep 50mHz/turn, so we are ~22.5 times faster than in reality.
# We keep the equivalent of the last 3 seconds (slightly higher integration time, in order not to lose too much statistics).
# We want to keep the last 3/22.5 seconds = 1500 turns.
# This is equal to:
seconds_to_keep = 3
